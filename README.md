# First-Project

Hello there! My name is Tyler. I am 29 years old. I'm currently living in Bakersfield, Ca. going to school for Information Technology and Information Security. I joined Github as a way to start building a portfolio while I'm in school. I look forward to learning and growing in this exciting field.
